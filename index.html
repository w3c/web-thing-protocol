    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document defines a WebSocket [[WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]] sub-protocol for
      monitoring and controlling connected devices over the Web.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> (WoT) is a
      collection of standardised technology building blocks that help provide
      interoperability on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of
        Things</a> (IoT). The WoT Thing Description specification
      [[wot-thing-description11]] defines a metadata format for
      <em>describing</em> the capabilities of &quot;Things&quot; (connected
      devices) on the Web. The WoT Discovery specification [[wot-discovery]]
      defines mechanisms for <em>discovering</em> Things on the Web. This
      specification complements those building blocks by
      defining a dedicated real-time protocol for <em>communicating</em> with Things over the
      Web.
    </p>
    <p>WebSockets [[WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]] provide a way to upgrade a
      standard HTTP [[HTTP11]] request to a full-duplex, persistent, real-time
      communication channel over a single TCP connection. This can be used to
      create a versatile and efficient two-way channel with which a WoT
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-consumer">Consumer</a>
      can communicate with one or more
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-web-thing">Things</a>
      [[wot-architecture11]] to carry out the full set of WoT
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/#table-well-known-operation-types">operations</a>.
      However, since a WebSocket is essentially just a raw TCP socket with no
      semantics of its own, a sub-protocol needs to be defined in order for a
      Consumer and Thing to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>Whilst many other <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml#subprotocol-name">WebSocket
        sub-protocols</a> exist, what makes the Web Thing Protocol unique
      is that it is specifically designed around the Web of Things
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/#sec-vocabulary-definition">information
        model</a> and
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/#table-well-known-operation-types">set
        of operations</a> [[wot-thing-description11]], as well as being
      targeted specifically at Web of Things use cases [[wot-usecases]]. It
      can therefore be thought of as being native to the Web of Things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sub-protocol defines message payload formats for each of the
      well-known
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/#table-well-known-operation-types">
        operation types</a> defined in the WoT
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#sec-interaction-model">
        interaction model</a> [[wot-architecture11]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification is intended to complement deliverables of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/wg/">WoT Working Group</a>, including WoT
      Architecture [[wot-architecture11]], WoT Thing Description
      [[wot-thing-description11]], WoT Discovery [[wot-discovery]],
      WoT Binding Templates [[wot-binding-templates]] and WoT Profile
      [[wot-profile]]. It is intended to implement use cases and requirements
      defined in the
      <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/web-thing-protocol/CG-FINAL-web-thing-protocol-requirements-20231101/">Web
        Thing Protocol Use Cases & Requirements</a> community report.
    </p>
    <p>Whilst this document is not on a standards track, the Web Thing Protocol
      is intended to eventually join a standards track at the W3C or another
      standards body such as the IETF.

  <section id="deployment-models" class="informative">
    <h1>Deployment Models</h1>
    <p>The Web Thing Protocol is intended to operate within three key deployment models depending on whether a Web Thing
      is hosted by a connected device, by an on-premises Web of Things gateway, or an off-premises Web of Things cloud
      service.</p>
    <p>These three deployment models are common across a range of different application domains.</p>
    <p>For a broader discussion of deployment models for the Web of Things in general, see <a
        href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/#sec-common-deployment-patterns">Common Deployment Patterns</a> in
      Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 1.1 [[wot-architecture11]].</p>
    <section id="deployment-model-direct">
      <h2>Direct</h2>
      <p>The direct deployment model is when a Consumer communicates directly with an IoT device using the Web Thing
        Protocol.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/direct_deployment_model.png"
          alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer directly communicating with a collection of connected devices using the Web Thing Protocol." />
        <figcaption>Direct deployment model</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In this deployment model, the IoT device itself must act as an HTTP and WebSockets server which serves its own
        Thing Description and can maintain a WebSocket connection with a Consumer.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="deployment-model-gateway">
      <h2>Gateway</h2>
      <p>The gateway deployment model is when a Consumer communicates with a connected device via a gateway on the same
        premises as the device, which bridges another protocol to the Web Thing Protocol.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/gateway_deployment_model.png"
          alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a collection of Web Things via a Web of Things gateway using the Web Thing Protocol." />
        <figcaption>Gateway deployment model</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In this deployment model, a gateway acts as an HTTP and WebSockets server which exposes a Web Thing for a
        connected device and translates WebSocket messages into messages of the device's native protocol (e.g. Zigbee,
        Z-Wave, Matter, Modbus or BACnet) over a local area network (LAN) or personal area network (PAN).</p>
      <p>A gateway can also act as a Consumer which consumes Web Things using the direct deployment model, and can be
        used to proxy a Web Thing from one network to another.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/gateway_deployment_model2.png"
          alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a Web of Things gateway using the Web Thing protocol and the gateway also communicating with a collection of connected devices using the Web Thing Protocol." />
        <figcaption>Gateway deployment model with gateway also acting as a Consumer</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>
    <section id="deployment-model-cloud">
      <h2>Cloud</h2>
      <p>The cloud deployment model is when a Consumer communicates with an IoT device via cloud service on the
        internet, which communicates with the device using some other protocol on the back end.</p>
    </section>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/cloud_deployment_model.png"
        alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a collection of connected devices via cloud service using the Web Thing Protocol." />
      <figcaption>Cloud deployment model</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In this deployment model, a cloud service hosted in a data centre acts as an HTTP and WebSockets server which
      exposes a Web Thing for an IoT device and translates WebSocket messages into messages using another IoT protocol
      (e.g. AMQP or MQTT).</p>
    <p>The cloud deployment model differs from the gateway deployment model in that the Web Thing is hosted on different
      premises to the IoT device it represents and communicates with the device over the internet.</p>
    <p>A cloud service can also act as a Consumer which consumes Web Things that use the direct or gateway deployment
      model, and can be used to proxy a Web Thing from one origin to another.</p>

      <img src="images/cloud_deployment_model2.png"

        particular sequence of message types, outlined in the table below:</p>

            complete.
            For asynchronous Actions a Thing responds immediately to an <code>invokeaction</code> request with a
            <code>status</code> member containing a unique <code>actionID</code>, which can then be used to query or
            cancel the Action instance using a separate <code>queryaction</code> or <code>cancelaction</code> operation
            respectively.
            If a Consumer sends an <code>invokeaction</code> request for an Action whose ActionAffordance has a
            <code>synchronous</code> member set to <code>false</code>, it should therefore expect to receive a response
            containing a <code>status</code> member rather than an <code>output</code> member.

            When an Action instance is cancelled with a <code>cancelaction</code> operation, its ActionStatus object is
            deleted and need not be retained. For all other <a>Action</a> instances it is assumed that once an action is
            completed the Thing will store its ActionStatus object so that its status
            may later be queried with a <code>queryaction</code> or <code>queryallactions</code> operation. It is not
            expected that ActionStatus objects should be retained indefinitely, they may be stored in volatile memory
            and/or periodically pruned. The length of time for which to retain ActionStatus objects is expected to be
            implementation-specific and may depend on application-specific requirements or resource constraints. It is
            recommended that at least the last instance of a completed action status should be stored.

      data payloads, since this is expected to be implementation specific. For example, it is up to an implementor to
      of a <a>Thing</a> to decide whether an <a>Action</a> instance invoked by one user can be queried by another user,
