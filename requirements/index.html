      <p>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for a common sub-protocol for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> to enable ad-hoc interoperability between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-web-thing">Web Things</a> and their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-consumer">Consumers</a>. This includes requirements for an HTTP sub-protocol and a WebSocket sub-protocol which define a standard way to monitor and control a connected device over the World Wide Web.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      <p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> (WoT) is to counter the fragmentation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) using web technologies. By providing standardised metadata and other re-usable technological building blocks, W3C WoT enables easy integration across IoT platforms and application domains.</p>
      <p>The W3C WoT Thing Description [[wot-thing-description]] specification defines the first building block of the Web of Things, by defining an information model and JSON-based representation format for describing the capabilities of connected devices and the interfaces with which to communicate with them.</p>
      <p>The Thing Description specification is designed to be protocol-agnostic and flexible enough to describe a wide range of existing (&quot;brownfield&quot;) IoT devices, rather than specifying a fixed protocol or application programming interface (API) which all devices must implement. The downside of this open ended flexibility is that it makes ad-hoc interoperability on the Web of Things very difficult, because it's nearly impossible to create a single <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-consumer"></a>WoT Consumer</a> which is guaranteed to be able to communicate with any <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#dfn-web-thing"></a>Web Thing</a> [[wot-architecture]] out of the box.</p>
      <p>The WoT Thing Protocol specification will be designed to complement the WoT Thing Description specification [[wot-thing-description]] by defining a common sub-protocol for the Web of Things such that any WoT Consumer and Web Thing which implement the specification will be guaranteed to be able to communicate with each other other out of the box, without device-specific customisation.</p>
      <p>The Web Thing Protocol specification (or specifications) will define:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An <a href="#http-sub-protocol">HTTP sub-protocol</a> (REST API) which defines a standard way to communicate with a Web Thing using the HTTP protocol [[HTTP11]]</li>
        <li>A <a href="#websocket-sub-protocol">WebSocket sub-protocol</a> which defines how to communicate with a Web Thing over the WebSockets protocol [[WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]]</li>
     </ul>
     <p>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for such a specification, based on existing Web of Things implementations and the collective experience of members of the Web Thing Protocol Community Group.</p>
     <p>In addition to the WoT Thing Description, the Web Thing Protocol Community Group should aim for the Web Thing Protocol specification to complement other deliverables in progress by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">WoT Working Group</a> where possible, including WoT Discovery [[wot-discovery]], WoT Binding Templates [[wot-binding-templates]] and WoT Profile [[wot-profile]]. It's possible some of the requirements below may be fulfilled by those specifications. The Web Thing Protocol specification itself, or subsections of it, are intended to eventually join a standards track at the W3C or another standards body such as the IETF.</p>

    <section id="deployment-models">
      <h1>Deployment Models</h1>
      <p>The Web Thing Protocol will need to operate within three key deployment models depending on whether a Web Thing is hosted by a connected device, by an on-premises Web of Things gateway, or an off-premises Web of Things cloud service.</p>
      <p>These three deployment models are common across a range of different application domains.</p>
      <p>For a broader discussion of deployment models for the Web of Things in general, see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/#sec-common-deployment-patterns">Common Deployment Patterns</a> in Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 1.1 [[wot-architecture11]].</p>
      <section id="deployment-model-direct">
        <h2>Direct</h2>
        <p>The direct deployment model is when a Consumer communicates directly with an IoT device using the Web Thing Protocol.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/direct_deployment_model.png" alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer directly communicating with a collection of connected devices using the Web Thing Protocol." />
          <figcaption>Direct deployment model</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this deployment model, the IoT device itself must act as an HTTP server which serves its own Thing Description and can respond to HTTP requests or maintain a WebSocket connection with a Consumer.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="deployment-model-gateway">
        <h2>Gateway</h2>
        <p>The gateway deployment model is when a Consumer communicates with a connected device via a gateway on the same premises as the device, which bridges another protocol to the Web Thing Protocol.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/gateway_deployment_model.png" alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a collection of Web Things via a Web of Things gateway using the Web Thing Protocol." />
          <figcaption>Gateway deployment model</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this deployment model, a gateway acts as an HTTP server which exposes a Web Thing for a connected device and translates HTTP and/or WebSocket messages into messages of the device's native protocol (e.g. Zigbee, Z-Wave, HomeKit, Modbus or BACnet) over a local area network (LAN) or personal area network (PAN).</p>
        <p>A gateway can also act as a Consumer which consumes Web Things using the direct deployment model, and can be used to proxy a Web Thing from one network to another.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/gateway_deployment_model2.png" alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a Web of Things gateway using the Web Thing protocol and the gateway also communicating with a collection of connected devices using the Web Thing Protocol." />
          <figcaption>Gateway deployment model with gateway also acting as a Consumer</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section id="deployment-model-cloud">
        <h2>Cloud</h2>
        <p>The cloud deployment model is when a Consumer communicates with an IoT device via cloud service on the internet, which communicates with the device using some other protocol on the back end.</p>
      </section>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/cloud_deployment_model.png" alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a collection of connected devices via cloud service using the Web Thing Protocol." />
        <figcaption>Cloud deployment model</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In this deployment model, a cloud service hosted in a data centre acts as an HTTP server which exposes a Web Thing for an IoT device and translates HTTP and/or WebSocket messages into messages using another IoT protocol (e.g. AMQP or MQTT).</p>
      <p>The cloud deployment model differs from the gateway deployment model in that the Web Thing is hosted on different premises to the IoT device it represents and communicates with the device over the internet.</p>
      <p>A cloud service can also act as a Consumer which consumes Web Things that use the direct or gateway deployment model, and can be used to proxy a Web Thing from one origin to another.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/cloud_deployment_model2.png" alt="A diagram showing a WoT Consumer communicating with a Web of Things cloud service using the Web Thing protocol and the cloud service also communicating with a collection of connected devices and a Web of Things Gateway using the Web Thing Protocol." />
