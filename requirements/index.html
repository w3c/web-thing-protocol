      <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> (WoT) is to define a standard way to communicate with connected devices using the World Wide Web, in order to provide a unifying application layer for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) and promote ad-hoc interoperability between devices.</p>
     <p>The W3C [[WOT-THING-DESCRIPTION]] specification defines the first building block of the Web of Things, by defining an information model and data format for describing the capabilities of a connected device and the interfaces with which to communicate with it.</p>
     <p>The Thing Description specification was designed to be protocol-agnostic and flexible enough to describe a broad range of existing devices, rather than specifying a fixed protocol or application programming interface (API) which all devices must implement. The downside of this open ended flexibility is that it makes ad-hoc interoperability on the Web of Things very difficult, because it's nearly impossible to create a single WoT client which is guaranteed to be able to communicate with any WoT device.</p>
     <p>The Web Thing Protocol specification will be designed to complement the WoT Thing Description specification by defining a common sub-protocol for the Web of Things, such that any WoT client and WoT device (or "web thing") which follow the specification will be able to communicate with each other.</p>
     <p>The Web Thing Protocol specification will define:
       <ul>
         <li>An <a href="#http-sub-protocol">HTTP sub-protocol</a> (REST API) which defines a standard way to communicate with a web thing using the [[HTTP11]] protocol</li>
         <li>A <a href="#websocket-sub-protocol">WebSocket sub-protocol</a> which defines how to communicate with a web thing over the [[WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]]</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for such a specification, based on existing Web of Things implementations and the collective experience of members of the Web Thing Protocol Community Group.</p>
     <p>In addition to the WoT Thing Description specification, the Web Thing Protocol Community Group should aim for the Web Thing Protocol specification to complement other deliverables in progress by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">WoT Working Group</a> where possible, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-profile/">WoT Profile</a>. It's possible some of the requirements below may be fulfilled by those specifications. The Web Thing Protocol specification itself, or subsections of it, are intended to eventually join a standards track at the W3C or another standards body such as the IETF.</p>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>WoT Clients</h3>
        <p>A WoT client is a software agent which monitors and controls a connected device on behalf of a user. This may include but is not limited to mobile applications, desktop applications, voice agents and mixed reality agents.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Things</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get a list of devices hosted by a web thing directory so that the user can monitor and control them.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get a list of web things representing devices in the physical proximity of the client so that the user can monitor and control them.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get a list of web things connected to the same local network as the client so that the user can monitor and control them.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get the Thing Description (metadata) for a device so that I know what operations can be performed on it and how to carry out those operations.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to discover what (sub-)protocols and file formats a device supports so that I know whether my client can communicate with it or not.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to tell a WoT device in what languages I would prefer human-readable strings to be provided in so that I can provide the user with text they can understand.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to authenticate with a device so that my client can be authorised to monitor and control it.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Properties</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to read the property of a device or be notified when its value changes so I can report its state to the user or automatically carry out an operation based on its value.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to set the value of a property of a device so that I can change its physical state.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Actions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to invoke an action on a device which modifies its state in such a way that can't be achieved by simply setting the value of a property. E.g. To carry out a function which takes a period of time to complete or has a different outcome based on provided arguments or current state.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get a list of instances of actions requested on a device so that I can find out their status</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to get the status of a requested action so that I can report its status back to the user or otherwise act on the basis of its status.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to cancel an action request so that I can prevent the outcome of the action from occuring before it is complete.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Events</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to be able to subscribe/unsubscribe to a particular type of event so I can choose which events I want to be notified of by a WoT device.</li>
            <li>As a WoT client developer I want to be notified when an event is emitted by a device so that I can notify the user or react accordingly (e.g. if a safety limit is reached).</li>

        <h3>WoT Devices</h3>
        <p>A WoT device or "web thing" is a virtual representation of a physical device on the web, which acts as a WoT server with which a WoT client can communicate. Examples might include an IP camera, a smart thermostat or an internet-connected robot.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Things</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to advertise the prescence of my device on a local network so that WoT clients can discover it</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to advertise the prescence of my device to WoT clients in its physical proximity so that they can discover it</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to report to WoT clients what (sub-)protocols and file formats my device supports so that they know whether they can communicate with the device</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to know what languages a WoT client would prefer for a Thing Description so that I can provide human readable strings in the most appropriate language for the end user</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to authenticate requests to my device so that only authorised clients can monitor and control it</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Properties</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to be able to report the value of a property to a WoT client when the client requests its value or the value changes, so that the client can be kept up to date with the value of the property</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to provide the ability for a WoT client to set the value of a property so that the client can affect a physical change in state of the device</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Actions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to change the physical state of the device in response to an action request from a WoT client which is more complex than simply setting the value of a property (e.g. an operation which takes a period of time to complete)</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to provide a WoT client with a list of instances of requested actions on a device so that the client can find out their status</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to be able to report the status of an action request to a WoT client when requested or when the status changes so that the client can be informed whether the action has been completed</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to cancel a running action at the request of a WoT client so that an action can be stopped before it has completed</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Events</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want my WoT device to be informed when a WoT client wants to subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications of a particular type of event so that I only need to notify clients which have subscribed.</li>
            <li>As a WoT device developer I want to be able to notify a WoT client when an event occurs so that the client can react accordingly (e.g. if a safety limit is reached).</li>

        <h3>WoT Gateways & Directories</h3>
        <p>A WoT gateway is hardware and/or software which bridges communications with a connected device from the Web Thing Protocol to another protocol, or acts as a proxy to bridge the Web Thing Protocol from one network to another. A WoT gateway may act as both a WoT client and WoT server (when acting as a proxy), or just as a WoT server (when briding other protocols to the Web of Things).</p>
        <p>A WoT gateway may monitor and control WoT devices based on user commands issued via a WoT client, or automatically carry out operations on behalf of users based on changes in state or other criteria. Examples might include a smart home hub, the central computer system of a vehicle, or control software for a smart city.<p>
        <p>A WoT directory is a service which provides a list of web things and links to their Thing Descriptions.</p>
        <p>A WoT gateway may provide a directory of web things it hosts and may be hosted on-premises with devices (e.g. in the case of bridging a PAN protocol like Zigbee or Bluetooth to the Web of Things) or on a server on separate premises to devices (e.g. in the case of a cloud service bridging another IP-based protocol to the Web of Things).</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Things</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>As a WoT directory developer I want to provide a list of web things that my directory provides so that a WoT client knows where to get their Thing Descriptions.</li>
            <li>As a WoT directory developer I want to provide a way for clients to add and remove web things from the directory so that the directory can be kept up to date.</li>
            <li>As a WoT directory developer I want to notify WoT clients when a web thing is added or removed from the directory so that they can be kept up to date with the latest list of things.</li>
            <li>As a WoT directory developer I want to notify WoT clients when the Thing Description of a web thing is updated so that they know when to retrieve a new version.</li>
            <li>As a WoT gateway developer I want to bridge non-web IoT protocols (e.g. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, ONVIF or MQTT) to the Web Thing Protocol so that a WoT client can monitor and control them without needing to directly support all of those protocols.</li>
            <li>As a WoT gateway developer I want to discover WoT devices on a local network so that my gateway can proxy them to another network.</li>
